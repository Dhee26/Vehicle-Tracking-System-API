# Vehicle Tracking System
Track vehicles position using GPS navigation. A device em boarded in a vehicle, will communicate with your API to register the vehicle and update its position.

Implement a RESTful API to track vehicles location. The device will update the API every 30 seconds with the new location.

Register a vehicle
Record its position
When the frontend team will implement the backoffice for the vehicle tracking, any authenticated administrator should be able to :

Retrieve the current position of a vehicle
Retrieve the positions of a vehicle during a certain time, in order to display their journey on a map (maps drawing is out of scope)
